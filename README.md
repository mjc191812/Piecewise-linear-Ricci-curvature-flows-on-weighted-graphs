## Abstract
Discrete Ricci curvature formulations offer novel perspectives for characterizing geometric properties of weighted graphs. This work proposes continuous piecewise linear Ricci curvature flows and develops their discrete counterparts for community detection applications.
When rigorously compared to Ollivier's Ricci curvature flow, our flow exhibits two fundamental advantages:
1. Solutions inherently possess globally defined existence and uniqueness;
2. After multiple surgeries on edges, a solution achieves a constant Ricci curvature in each connected components.
The theoretical framework builds upon classical ordinary differential equation theory, with rigorous experimental validation confirming that the piecewise linear flow attains detection accuracy comparable to existing approaches in practical community detection scenarios.
